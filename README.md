# bukket
A project for the [DH2642](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2642) course using the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/).

Created by Axel Elmarsson and Douglas Fischer.

## Why is this repo called moist?
We changed project plan in the middle of the assignment because the previous API we used sucked.

# Description
bukket is an interactive bucket list app . You get random suggestions of activities to add to your bucket list. You can organize your bucket list items: filter, sort, mark as done, etc. We get activity suggestions from the API. We store everything in our own database.

# Done
* Fully functional registration and login system.
* Basic bucket list functions
* Api calls that generate random tasks

# TODO
* User interaction: Filter bucketlist, mark as done, hide, add notes.
* Option to add custom bucket list items
* Account settings: Set profile picture, see account settings, etc.
* See other bucket lists: Search for friend's bucket lists
